                Welcome to Chopoklok, <strong>your favourite online Restaurant Service with no boundary. </strong>
                <em>"We are just a tablet away". </em><br/>
                The main idea behind chopoklok is to curb client-server arguments in food service setups(Restaurants). 
                It seems to have been a noticed problem in food service setups (restaurants) when clients tend to complain 
                of arriving earlier than others whoâ€™ve been served before them and the time it takes for a customer to think 
                of choices before actually placing an order. 
                This Web App(chopoklok) is to be created and made available online such that clients, either within or without 
                the food service premise can take their time and navigate through the list of all available items, make their choices, 
                places their orders and choose whether it should be delivered at their destinations or indicate if they are coming 
                to pick their commands up themselves from the food service shop. 
                We are confident that once this idea is realised, will solve this problem and minimise the client-server conflicts by 
                making it possible for all client placed orders to be aligned in the kitchen just in the order in which they were 
                submitted so that those working in the kitchen can follow the orders from the oldest on the order list down to the most 
                recent thereby reducing complaints of delay in service.
                So feel at home and place your order wherever and whenever.<br/>
